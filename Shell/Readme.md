# OS_Assignment

1. Creating a custom shell
2. Run 'cd testFolder' or 'cat first.c' or any other system commands to test built-in commands
3. Run 'grep -o foo foo.txt | ./wc' to test pipe

Issues:

1. Segmentation fault when gave history command in wrong format (fixed)
2. Segmentation fault on empty command (fixed)

Things yet to be added:
1. Will system commands be checked in pipe?
